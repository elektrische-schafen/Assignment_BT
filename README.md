## Chatbot Development
*	Build a chatbot that can respond meaningfully to a wide range of user inputs (you can mimic the answers of a chatbot by using the test/train files or use an API to retrieve real answers).
*	Responses should be contextually relevant, grammatically correct, and semantically appropriate.
*	You may use rule-based, retrieval-based, or generative models.
*	**Bonus:** Indicate how you would include memory or personalization features.

## Query Categorization
*	Implement a classification model that predicts the category of the user query.
*	Categories should be clearly defined and justified.
*	Use NLP techniques such as embeddings, transformers, or classical ML models.
*	Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix.

## Autonomous Agent Design (Optional but Encouraged)
* Design (do not implement it) agents that can take actions based on query intent (e.g., booking a meeting, retrieving a document, sending a notification).
* Demonstrate modularity and scalability of your agent architecture.
